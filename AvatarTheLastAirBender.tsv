i****2	Finish watching. I don't know but I'm kinda dissappointed on the last episode. I actually waited to see Aang do some amazing actions but still did'nt see until the end. The movie sucks but I remember to have goosebump on the last scene where he manage to do waterbending. Did not have that feeling into netflix adaptation.	0	0	None	2024-03-02 12:10:39 AM	2024-03-02 12:10:39 AM	2011-08-30 11:41:02 AM

r****0	1st season watched, I really like hopefully the next ones are going to be good too🎉 The only problem is that you should make the characters less serious and let them be more goofy as the original because not everything needs to be that serious.	0	0	None	2024-03-01 10:39:47 AM	2024-03-02 06:52:15 AM	2014-04-13 06:38:30 PM

a****z	This show was a big disappointment.After watching the original series and the legend of korra multiple times and being a big fan of the anime Netflix just couldn't help themselves to put their woke ideologies into the show.

a****a	ITS TRASH. The first episode is so disappointing. Literally just watch the whole animated series & Kora & call it a day.Unless your standards are low & you are into modern, terrible 2024 shows, wack dialogue & lots of special effects, then this shitty show will be for you! 🙂 If you are desperate & have low standards, then you might find enjoyment from 9 hours of the episodes.I’m told I shouldn’t compare this t.v series to the animated version, but it’s so hard when 50% of the dialogue is RIPPED FROM THE ANIMATED VERSION. Nothing will ever compare to or touch how much I loved the avatar animated series & The Legend of Kora. They were so well done & so easy to get into ❤️ I had higher hopes for this show, and I’m glad I watched the first episode, but I would literally rather do anything else that watch this PIECE OF GARBAGE that was produced. The only hype they have is THE NAME. Everything else about it is cringe, corny and not my cup of tea	0	0	None	2024-02-29 12:32:57 AM	2024-02-29 12:32:57 AM	2008-08-19 09:37:09 PM

K****r	Just started it now! its great so far... (never saw the movie) absolutely loved ATLA as a child watching it on Nickelodeon. Now I'm 27 so far think the casting is great. Everyone from the different nations are all from the races that they represented, which Ithink is fantastic. My childhood anime/cartoon crush was katara mean she doesn't really look the same. Don't get me wrong the actress is cute but she doesn't look the same (and yes I'm comparing drawings to real life people) so don't 'at me'!

l****k	I just finished watching the series and there's only one thing that's bothering me. THE LACK OF EMOTION AND EXPRESSION IN SOME ACTOR'S FACES AND BODY MOVEMENT. Everything is absolutely great, from the effects, especially on their bending, it's way way waaaaayyy more better than that of the movie. Zuko and Sokka I think made justice in their characters, I am not sure about Aang and Katara, especially Katara (sorry girl). I think she lacks facial and body expression, in all episodes I feel like I am watching an actor that is reading (literally) a script. Same goes to Aang, he's not a bad actor but not that great either, but his presence is shouting Aang so that's a great point I guess. whenever they are in serious dialogue, I can feel from their body movement the awkwardness and lack of emotions. BUT OVERALL THIS ADAPTATION DESERVES A SECOND SEASON, IT DESERVES TO FINISH TILL THE FINAL CHAPTER!!

T****m	I had no idea the original creators left because they knew the show was going to be a disaster and had no creative control. I am so sick and tired of these modern creators ruining every beloved IP in the west. I seriously thought Netflix learned its lesson with one piece live action. But nope. Another “modern audience” disaster incoming.	2	0	None	2024-01-31 06:27:45 PM	2024-01-31 06:28:34 PM	2013-01-20 11:01:48 AM

e****s	if you ever watch Avatar Aang, Sokka is comical characters. I can expect a laugh just looking at the character, this live action looks like he is sub characters from Twilight. It's a mockery to the CGI people that did great job and work hard for this. Trim your sides, Sokka actor, you are showing disrespect to the original characters by accepting the role, how hard is 1mm side trim.	2	2	ID	2024-01-28 06:21:04 AM	2024-01-28 06:36:35 AM	2013-12-11 07:25:22 AM

k****e	Ang should look Mean when I'm the avatar state, because he is not in control. He must look like possessed to be exact, but instead, he looks like no emotions at all. I'd Netflix doesn't tackle the personalities, emotions, anger and playful behavior of Ang, I highly doubt it they will make a good impression. Because Netflix is more concerned about the male up and the stage and picture quality while the acting part sucks. I can't let this film ruined my experience with the original series. I can't. I smell disappointment all over the place. They should have found real Chinese martial artist to play the fire nation and air benders characters. Just saying.	0	0	None	2024-01-20 02:43:58 AM	2024-01-20 02:43:58 AM	2011-02-13 03:14:40 PM
k****e	These main characters have good customs, but the way they act doesn't reflect the personalities nor the character of the original characters. And looks like too soft when in the avatar state, Zuko and the fire nation king as well. Nobody looks like angry nor evil. Everybody looks like getting along besides the story line says otherwise. Why is that so hard to accomplish? Is the director so out of touch he can't see what we see? And Zuko scar, what that heck is that? Doesn't even look like a scar at all but painted make up. He is too soft as well to be the son of the most evil man on earth. Not good Netflix. They don't even care. Whatever.

T****5	I don’t know if it’s just me or not but I have always wondered this about bending, why is that “Fire” seems to be the only element that doesn’t need the element around to bend?  Cuz with “Air” you just assume it always around all the time but with “Water” and “Earth” you never see bender just those bender those elements unless they are near water, for example.  Yet a “Fire” bender just snaps his fingers and a flame appears even if they are in a desert.  So how does it work?	0	0	None	2024-01-20 12:29:42 AM	2024-01-20 12:31:03 AM	2006-03-16 05:10:32 AM

e****7	this is going to be so bad, no one needs this half baked mess, nothing will come ever close to the nice and simple original, when i see this lazy excuse of cgi, i very much hope it fails, so that studios like netflix learn their lesson to invest money in the right spots, look at pirates of the caribbean, it has cgi 10 times better and is 10+ years old, like how hard can you mess up? Netflix yes ) and dont forget, there is a reason the original authors left the project, i dont expect from the writing either, this is going to ve delightful in terms of the next big failure	0	1	None	2024-01-19 06:09:19 AM	2024-01-19 06:27:59 AM	2020-06-22 12:03:14 PM

s****y	I must admit that I am not convinced, yet. I know that it's supposed to have a sort of cartoonish value to it, but I almost am not sure if this knows which direction it wants its tone to convey- serious, thrilling live-action, or pure homage to light-hearted, but philosophical kids show. I am sure it will tow the line, but this is the difficulty in adapting something that was once Korean animation, into something that embodies whole or in part, real life. The cinematography is really only an amalgam of what I already disliked about the original live-action movie in the first place, although I will say so far the fire bending effects look incredible. I was disappointed that the trailer has not yet chosen to show the "master benders performing their bending art" as perfected by Sifu Kisu. He consulted with the original creators of the show to create a bio-kinetic martial art form for each bending style that best represented the movement orientation (such as Northern Shaolin for Firebending, and Ba'gua for Airbending) that each nation had with respects to its chief element; Tai Chi respects the nature of push and pull, the Tui and La, and this is naturally described in the first season of the show, which is also why it is alled "Book I Water", just for example.. It's really important to show this detail of bending style differences, and is part of why it was included in the original show's intro. Does anyone know if Kisu was a consultant on this show as well? It would only make sense. If he wasn't, then who would know better than he does?	0	0	None	2024-01-19 12:10:25 AM	2024-01-19 12:10:25 AM	2012-11-13 03:12:51 PM

M****4	While on my way to work I applied my foot to the breaks in the hopes of stopping just in time. I did not stop in time and hit someone's fender. Luckily the man was bald head and knew how to air bend. Before he left, he told me I hope this is your last time being a careless driver. After 5 minutes of looking for him he vanished. 2 weeks later at a McDonalds I thought I saw him because a bald man walked in the store just as the wind blew, yes I work at McDonalds in this story. Anyways... He walked and said he wanted to buy a burger I asked if he was the bald head dude that I hit, he didn't say a word. I told him, hey man I don't like bald people not telling me there name. He said his name was ang or something. He told me he came from Memphis and likes to listen to jazz occasionally. After a bit of time I realized this man was the last air bending fry cooker. I told my manager about his wonderful powers to keep the fries evenly distributed so you get a 5050 ratio, oil to potato. After his disappearance we were attacked by the Karan's. Their power growing stronger and stronger. When the restaurant needed you the most you disappeared, I said. Now that he was back turns out he had about 2 weeks of PTO so I guess he didn't really have to work. Since he didn't enter his time in though that did have to be readjusted so he wouldn't get fired when he was on break. The fry cooking bender returned to making those delicious fries and he was really good at it. Maybe he was ang or Paul not sure... He does this cool thing where the arrow on his head turns blue and he just serves food slightly faster idk what he calls it but it keeps me from having to walk to people so I will take it as a win!	1	0	None	2024-01-15 02:57:31 AM	2024-01-15 02:57:31 AM	2023-10-12 01:07:12 AM

J****I	Let's hope they stick the landing. I love the anime, but it's notoriously hard to convert so much story (even if it's just e.g. book 1) into a movie. The movie would need to be like 200 minutes long ... maybe even two 200-minute movies (that's almost 5 hours) because each season/book is like 400-440 minutes long. So 3 movies, each being 3.5 hours each might do it justice... might.	0	5	None	2024-01-10 04:24:51 PM	2024-01-10 04:24:51 PM	2010-11-21 11:02:35 PM

j****2	Sends shivers down my spine, but still HIGHLY skeptical that it will be any good. And again it is still a just another soulless live action remake cash grab I can tell  as again they are try ing tot improve on perfection. Seriously instead of remaking classic media cartoons anime and movies MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL, OR AT LEAST FROM A GOOD BOOK THAT LACKS AN ADAPTATION. For example Eragon still needs a GOOD movie or better yet a TV series as the first attempt to adapt it was total crap in part because it was made too soon, and cut KEY plot elements from the story that was still being written. Also it was like they did not even read the book before writing the script, and casting the characters relying on second or third hand accounts from people they knew for their knowledge of the story and characters.	1	1	None	2024-01-09 11:58:29 PM	2024-01-09 11:58:29 PM	2021-04-21 10:25:44 PM

Y****w	Hmm I'm guessing based on the trailer and nothing else that this is trying appeal to the now older fans of avatar when it first ran Maybe delve into the lore more and make it more serious and brooding.... but given that it's not showing any indication of having a light heated side which was necessary to make avatar as endearing as it has become I predict some backlash after the shows out.	0	3	None	2024-01-08 04:25:45 PM	2024-01-08 04:25:45 PM	2011-11-08 04:43:47 AM

m****5	Oh, the f*ck. I was hoping they will not try to make an adaptation. The most hurting truth to modern day apologisers is that the criticisers of the previous film were totally wrong. We already saw asian faces in Mulan.ATLA was beautiful because in this amerime as well as in japanese cartoons there s no truly asian faces, only whites. That s because europeoid type is the most diversive in quantity of colours, europeoids are more coloured then asians😊	0	1	RU	2024-01-03 03:18:16 PM	2024-01-03 03:18:16 PM	2016-05-31 09:28:14 AM

t****3	Remember people, the writers of the original show, who were supposed to also write this show, left due to creative differences.

G****s	Yes, it will be better than the Shyamalan adaptation, because he set the bar incredibly low. It still doesn't need to exist though, and will not be better than the original cartoon, which I implore people to watch at some point if they're even remotely interested in this adaptation. Additionally, a ton of the scenery is not great CGI, it looks like it's straight out of a video game or pixar film, which never mixes well with live action. Zuko, Ozai, and Iroh look mostly fine. Almost all the skin in this looks way too smooth, they've definitely done something to it in post, and it puts the actors straight into the uncanny valley. Aang's tattoos look like face paint. Sokka looks fine. The Kyoshi Warriors look great. Appa and Momo look fine. Ozai's throne room looks good (probably low light masking the same unfinished looking CGI). Idk, I might watch this, or rewatch the original and have an experience that I know isn't going to rip me out of my suspension of disbelief every time there's an establishing shot.	1	0	GB	2023-12-29 04:55:49 AM	2023-12-29 04:55:49 AM	2013-11-08 04:23:19 PM

a****g	The original Avatar had lessons and insights reflecting traditional and tested wisdom, abundant humor, and a considerable amount of good old common sense. Furthermore, the character development and nuanced introspective manifestations of those characters were genius. If this manages to replicate that, it might just be a modern miracle. However, like many movies and other releases that I don't watch, they likely relied on visual effects to the point of being a crutch, neglecting the deep quality that made the original Avatar a legendary series.	55	8	None	2023-12-27 09:09:19 PM	2023-12-27 09:09:19 PM	2013-06-20 12:24:15 PM

S****r	I am hoping beyond all hope that they stay true and faithful to the original and do not change the story or characters "for a modern audience". Last airbender was a formative animation for many peoples childhoods. All everyone wants to see is a fricken faithful adaptation of the originals in live action. Please please dont screw this up.

J****_	Visually good, but overall not reassuring. Characters look great, but let's be real any actor can stare into a camera. The show was a cartoon and had a lot of expressiveness. This trailer and these kid actors all dead stare into the camera. Avatar was story driven, with the dialogue being the best selling point. What this trailer needed was a narrative with the characters sharing something of their journey. That is the core of avatar. For me, not showing that makes me think Netflix isn't confident in their own product. if the acting is too serious it's going to be way  too corny.	0	3	None	2023-12-26 09:40:33 PM	2023-12-26 09:40:33 PM	2011-06-29 04:25:12 PM

The animated version is longer with multiple episodes explained in detail and the movie that released before this shortened everything which disappointed the fans including me.

s****7	I dunno…. This seems a lil “The unmentionable movie we all hate”ish. Mostly because it was all darkness and intensity, without a single lick of the iconic lightness and humor and depth of character we all love about the series. I know this is just the trailer and it’s short. But the trailer sets the tone. With the exception of Aang smiling momentarily and a brief visual of Momo who makes us smile by his presence alone, this trailer was pure intensity and drama. And I hoped that maybe there would be a hint of the humor here. A way to let those of us, the OG fans,  who truly love the original series know - “don’t worry, we didn’t mess this amazing show up, agaaaain”   So far I didn’t see it. I’m worried already 😕.  Everyone has high hopes but this trailer gives me pause to wonder if I should just lower my expectations and go along for the visual ride. Expecting round 2 of the first series portrayal and utter cinematic flop and if we get anything above that to rejoice with a showering of confetti in the shape and taste of popcorn. Yeah, it’ll just be popcorn. Side note  I’m unsure at present how I feel about the borrowing of the Lion King quote. I don’t yet know if that proves to be a clever nod to another classic daddy issues story or just a general lack of creativity the script and it’s characters that deliver it will display.

s****7	Avatar The Last Airbender (2024) Update SynopsisThe series is set in an Asiatic, war-torn world where certain people can "bend" one of the four classical elements—water, earth, fire, or air. Aang, the "Avatar" and the last living Airbender, is the "bridge" between the mortal and spirit world, and the only one capable of bending all four of the elements. The Avatar maintains the balance of the world and nature to bring peace, and Aang is now faced with the responsibility of ending the ambitions of the militaristic Fire Nation to conquer the world. With his new companions Katara and Sokka, Aang sets out to master the four classical elements while pursued by the exiled Fire Nation crown prince Zuko, who seeks to regain his honor by capturing him.Avatar The Last Airbender Netflix Live Action Season 2 Cast Update SynopsisList of potential castings for the netflix live action avatar the last airbender season 2Avatar The Last Airbender Netflix Live Action Season 3 Cast Update SynopsisList of potential castings for the netflix live action avatar the last airbender season 3Avatar The Last Airbender (Netflix Season 1 - Book 1 Water) Update SynopsisAvatar on Netflix.

S****.	Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, the Avatar showrunner revealed his origins with Nickelodeon's beloved animated series, having watched Avatar with his daughter and, like many people, found its storytelling "just so epic and much beyond the audience it was targeted for." However, after joining the show, Kim had to deal with the public fallout of Avatar co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko leaving the project and the expectations of making the first live-action Avatar adaptation since M. Night Shyamalan's much-maligned The Last Airbender film. On trying to live up to these expectations, Kim admitted, "You'd have to be an idiot not to be intimidated a little bit. My first reaction after 'Hell yeah!' was 'Holy s---! Do I really want to do this? Is there a way to improve upon the original?' Whenever you tackle something that's already beloved by millions of fans, you have to ask yourself those questions."Ultimately, Kim decided to stick with Avatar given the original series' groundbreaking cultural roots in Eastern philosophy, mythology, and martial arts. Translating this to live-action, he pointed out, "meant setting new benchmarks for representation by featuring an all Asian and Indigenous cast," with Avatar casting Gordon Cormier, Kiawentiio Tarbell, and Ian Ousley as original Team Avatar leads Aang, Katara, and Sokka. Other notable additions include Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Kim's Convenience, The Mandalorian) as Iroh, Dallas Liu (PEN15) as Prince Zuko, Amber Midthunder (Prey) as Princess Yue, and Yvonne Chapman (Kung Fu) as former Avatar Kyoshi, amongst many more. Likewise, Kim was enthusiastic about the chance to retell Avatar over a decade after it created a multimedia franchise, stating, "That was really appealing to me, being able to bring this story to a new generation."-CBR	0	0	None	2023-12-22 06:47:32 AM	2023-12-22 06:47:32 AM	2022-10-09 02:16:30 AM

n****1	Ok, ok. I remembered when Shaymalan's trailer was first released. Had been very worried that an 8 hour 1st season clocked in at a 108 minute movie. I felt hopeful after the trailer. The best 3D I had seen st the time. Then the movie debute and I saw it opening weekend. Quite possibly the worst movie I had ever seen. The only great 3D was the footage that was also in the trailer. Only about 15 minutes of the entire movie was palatable and it contained no spoken lines. Seriously it reminded of the stage play at the end of book 3 because, aside from Katara being beautiful, she did cry for much of the movie, though she was the only one of the young stars aside from Zuko who delivered her terrible lines well, at least half the time. Uncle Iroh and (what was his name?) the Fire Lord performed well. For everyone else I had to wince and hidey head in shame.	0	0	None	2023-12-21 09:56:52 PM	2023-12-21 09:56:52 PM	2021-12-03 02:05:06 PM

m****5	Just watched through the series with my wife a couple weeks ago. I'm wondering how the Netflix show is going to handle the episode "Zuko Alone" when the racial ambiguity is no longer present because of the live action medium. In the animated series it is very easy to blend ethnicities to suspend disbelief for the viewer and because that episode is so pivotal to Zuko's development it is a must. I wonder how the characters are going to be able to look at Zuko and not immediately think he's fire nation. I guess we will have to wait and see since I don't recall seeing any Earth nation people in the teaser. I have high hopes Netflix. Don't let us down.	0	0	None	2023-12-20 09:52:35 PM	2023-12-20 09:52:35 PM	2012-10-14 08:38:55 PM

Incredible really - with that said,  I can safely say, that this recreation will be inferior. If anything, they should have updated the animation and sound of the old series.

m****7	Ok im gonna say it, I don’t think this looks good at all, and I think this going to turn out very bad. I don’t think ATLA (just like all anime/cartoon for that matter) isn’t meant to be live action. It just translates badly every time it’s done. I just now watched ATLA over again and there are so many moments that just don’t work in a live action adaption (lots of the humor for instance is dependent on overly comically faces of defying the laws of physics). Also the acting I hope the beats of the story hit the same and the actors can cary their roles. Especially for Aang who’s a 12 year old kid. The drama, carachter arcs and emotional moment hit so hard in the animated series and will require alot from that actor. That’s a lot to live up to. I sincerely hope that it’s going to work, but I doubt it very much…	2	1	None	2023-12-13 06:47:54 AM	2023-12-13 06:47:54 AM	2013-12-10 03:43:57 PM

P****O	for everyone whining over the movie, suck it up, go rewatch the movie, and only start comparing it to the show after its done. yes some bits are cut out, when a show gets turned into a movie some "filler" would get cut out, even if it did help with worldbuilding. however if it was given the chance at a sequel (or trilogy) it wouldn't be seen as the horrid memory you claim it to be.and from the looks of this teaser, it looks a bit too "fake", as if its a play where the actors have perfect makeup and their costumes have never even had a spec of dust on them before.... if that sounds familiar, congratulations you've watched the show.	0	1	None	2023-12-10 07:30:01 AM	2023-12-10 07:30:01 AM	2014-07-11 12:08:26 PM

m****2	This made me remind Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. That aint no positive thing. Ill bet it flops really hard. There is generations of people that grew up with movies like this. I guess that is there audience. But the thing i hate about movies like that is, that they can make something dangerous and awsome look like cute and dorkey. Like they did with THOR or SAURON in rings of power for example. From hero to zero. It feels for me more like a "Never ending story" rip off.

m****5	I just don't get why a live action avatar even needs to be made; all this effort to retell the same story that was already told perfectly, but now with the limitations of live action. Avatar lent itself so well to animation as a medium; I don't understand what could possibly be gained by recreating it in this way. The transition away from animation means losing so much of the humour, and the style, and the imagination that made the show so great.I appreciate that effort is being put into avatar, but I wish it was directed at continuing the series rather than recreating it when it was beloved to begin with. Attempting to outright recreate something that we all feel so nostalgic for is just never going to work out.	0	1	None	2023-12-03 01:04:18 PM	2023-12-03 01:04:18 PM	2016-01-27 02:32:15 PM

T****7	Oh boy, at the beginning I was ALL judgemental. Hate live actions. Thought everything was going to be another disaster. Then that scene of Omashu came out and I thought "Oh wow, that looks accurate and awesome", then "Oh wow, the casting looks spot on, fire lord looks identical". Then Aang showed up, then fire bending that looks accurate, then freaking Appa and momo identical to the originals?!!! THE MUSIC WITHOUT FREAKING DISGUSTING MIXING AND EDITING?!!!!

s****y	I hope there will be additions to the plotline... Things that that Nickolodean had to steer away from.A more intense plot was implied, but a Netflix remake seems like the perfect opportunity to convey the realities of generational traumas, sexism, genocide, and abuse that were affecying the world.The original show provides wisdom and inspiration, and this one should too. There are moments, however, where it felt like there were holes in the Nickolodean plotline. They had to leave out some stuff, and we know it.	0	1	US	2023-11-26 05:24:13 PM	2023-11-26 05:24:13 PM	2006-03-29 06:00:56 PM

a****2	Nah...sorry ya'll, not feelin' it. I like the animated series way more. I'll just go back to watching that. Sorry Netflix, I don't like it being real life actors. The interactions with Appa and Momo are so clearly fake, because those characters are full CGI.	1	0	None	2023-11-25 03:48:51 AM	2023-11-25 03:48:51 AM	2012-12-12 01:22:27 PM
